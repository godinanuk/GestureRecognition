# GestureRecognition
GestureRecognition with all pre-trained models and exclusive models

I will run through most of the famous pre-trained models and models which we create from scratch.

*** Please note the below results are for a particular data set and will be updated / tuned once I run through all the different models
1. Inception V3 - results - best validation accuracy 69% - best train accuracy 66% - epochs -> 30 with earlystopping - trainable parameters 19,402,757 -> image size 160x160x3
2. MobileNet V2 - results - best validation accuracy 81% - best train accuracy 82% - epochs -> 30 with earlystopping - trainable parameters 33,296,389 -> image size 160x160x3
3. ResNet50 - results - best validation accuracy 50% - best train accuracy 43% - epochs -> 30 with earlystopping - trainable parameters 34,082,821 -> image size 120120x3
